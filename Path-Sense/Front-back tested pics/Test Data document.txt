Document of How to Perform test or working of application:


Step 1: From A
Request:

json
{
  "currentNode": "A",
  "destinationNode": "E",
  "nextNodes": ["B","C","D"]
}
Expected response (example):

example putput be like:

json
{
  "nextNode": "B",
  "score": 0.12,
  "reasoning": "Exploit: chose B from A with Q(A,B)=0.12"
}

Next request payload should set currentNode to B.

Step 2:change node to B 
 From B
Request:

json
{
  "currentNode": "B",
  "destinationNode": "E",
  "nextNodes": ["D","C"]  
}
Expected response (example):

json
{
  "nextNode": "D",
  "score": 0.45,
  "reasoning": "Exploit: chose D from B with Q(B,D)=0.45"
}
Next request payload should set currentNode to D.

Step 3: From D
Request:

json
{
  "currentNode": "D",
  "destinationNode": "E",
  "nextNodes": ["E"]
}
Expected response (example):

json
{
  "nextNode": "E",
  "score": 3.10,
  "reasoning": "Exploit: chose E from D with Q(D,E)=3.10 (destination reward)"
}
You’ve reached the destination. Stop here.
Check redis for keys* and hgetAll A, B, C, D and E for their qvalues between them.
