I am Shreyas Kumar, a Java Backend Developer + ReactJS dev with close to three years of experience building scalable, production-grade systems. My work is centered on backend architecture, API design, performance, and reliability. I focus on building systems that solve real business problems, not just academic demos.

My current area of specialization is bringing Generative AI and Agentic AI into Java applications. I work on integrating LLMs with Spring Boot services, building AI-driven workflows, and designing agent-style backends capable of reasoning, planning, and executing tasks across services. This includes prompt orchestration, tool/function calling, retrieval-augmented generation, vector stores, and event-driven AI pipelines.

I actively explore and implement:

->GenAI integration with Java and Spring Boot

->Agentic AI systems that can take actions, not just generate text

->AI-assisted microservices and automation pipelines

->Secure API gateways and RBAC around AI features

My engineering approach is practical and systems-focused. I care about clean architecture, testability, observability, and designing services that can evolve. I constantly iterate on ideas, refine implementations, and convert concepts into working, deployable systems.

This repository reflects that journey: moving from traditional backend development toward AI-native backend engineering, where Java services are not just endpoints, but intelligent agents that can collaborate, decide, and automate work.
